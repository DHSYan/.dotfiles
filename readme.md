# PDE
At the start of University, I got drawn into the rabit hole of Vim.<br>
Later discovering NeoVim, and went all in. It began my journey with setting up, 
my PDE, Personal Development Enviroment, I have always like to tinker with tech,
and this have been my passion for the past couple months; Mastering the Development
Workflow. This took alot of inspiration from people like Prime, TJ, Chris, and many more.

# What this contains

## maci3
Scripts that I pull from github to make macOS have a awesome WM.
That emulates i3 on linux. 
The scripts are not mine, I found on it the Internet, they are Yabai, and skhd
and spacebar. 

## Nvim
The thing that started this whole thing.
Pulling alot of inspiration from ThePrimeagen. <br>
I crafted my NeoVim to cater what a Student might need. 
I didn't make any of the plugins that I used. They are all from github.


##  Tmux and ./Bin
These are aiming to make my life in the terminal as fast as possible.
With scripts that run C files, make new C files, creating lecture folder templates,
and moving around the system.

## Other
I am so sorry for all this terrible writing lol.

## Git
create a symlink from to the home dir, from the Git dir, it has the global gitignore file
