# PDE
At the start of University, I got drawn into the rabit hole of Vim.<br>
Later discovering NeoVim, and went all in. It began my journey with setting up, 
my PDE, Personal Development Enviroment, I have always like to tinker with tech,
and this have been my passion for the past couple months; Mastering the Development
Workflow. This took alot of inspiration from people like Prime, TJ, Chris, and many more.

# What this contains

## maci3
Scripts that I pull from github to make macOS have a awesome WM.
That emulates i3 on linux. 
The scripts are not mine, I found on it the Internet, they are Yabai, and skhd
and spacebar. 

## Nvim
The thing that started this whole thing.
Pulling alot of inspiration from ThePrimeagen. <br>
I crafted my NeoVim to cater what a Student might need. 
I didn't make any of the plugins that I used. They are all from github.


##  Tmux and ./Bin
These are aiming to make my life in the terminal as fast as possible.
With scripts that run C files, make new C files, creating lecture folder templates,
and moving around the system.

## Other
I am so sorry for all this terrible writing lol.

## Git
create a symlink from to the home dir, from the Git dir, it has the global gitignore file
### To stop git asking for password
- Add identitiy 
  - `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa`
### Improvement to Do
  - better git pushing and commiting scritps

#### To do
Change Vim clipboard register?
Better Remaps
Fugititive learning
Maybe do something about: "on mbp162022 the notch block text, maybe have something that 
detects if the cursor is at row 0, and do something about when it hit column notch"
Try Programmers Dvorak??
Change keyboard layout based on a shell? instead of the keyboard it self?
