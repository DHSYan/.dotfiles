# .dotfiles

# PDE
At the start of University, I got drawn into the rabit hole of Vim.<br>
Later discovering NeoVim, and went all in. It began my journey with setting up, 
my PDE, Personal Development Enviroment, I have always like to tinker with tech,
and this have been my passion for the past couple months; Mastering the Development
Workflow. This took alot of inspiration from people like Prime, TJ, Chris, and many more.

# What this contains

## ./bin
Many of my own script, notably rebuilding [my nixos](https://github.com/DHSYan/nixos), changing directory via
fuzzy finding, establishing a new obsidian vault, running c files, 
setting wallpaper via fuzzy find, sync-push and sync-pull from remote git 
repos to sync folders like my notes, .dotfiles, [dwm](https://github.com/DHSYan/dwm) and nixos config.


## ./latex-template
As a Math and CS student, Latex is probably one of the best tool you have in
your arsenal. I have templates for my lab reports and the occasional note 
taking.

## ./keyboard
Just some keyboard files that contains my Dactyl layout.

## ./nvim
The thing that started this whole thing.
Pulling alot of inspiration from ThePrimeagen. <br>
I crafted my NeoVim to cater what a Student might need. 
I didn't make any of the plugins that I used. They are all from github.

## ./obsidian
I use [obsidian to take notes](https://youtu.be/aIoEQC7w_UI?si=Eg_a7PG9J46pzIcw). 
This is my obsidian config, everything from theme, to hotkeys and plugins are 
here.
